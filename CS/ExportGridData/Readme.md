# DevExpress .NET MAUI Data Grid - Export Data

> NOTE
>
> The DevExpress .NET MAUI DataGrid Export feature requires the following license: [Office File API Suite (basic edition)](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/office-file-api/). Without a valid license, you will not be able to use this feature within your .NET MAUI application. If you own an active DevExpress Subscription (Universal, DXperience, WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET), the basic version of the DevExpress Office File API Suite is available to you.

This example illustrates how you can export .NET MAUI Data Grid records to the following formats:

* PDF
* XSLX
* DOCX
